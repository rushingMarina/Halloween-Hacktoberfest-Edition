            <p id="fact" class="card-text">Halloween is spooky. Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of All Hallows'
                Evening), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in
                a number of countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It
                begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to
                remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.</p>

            <p id="fact" class="card-text">Dressing up on Halloween comes from the Celts.
            Celts believed Samhain was a time when the wall between our world and the paranormal world was porous and spirits could get through. Because of this belief, it was common for the Celts to wear costumes and masks during the festival to ward off or befuddle any evil spirits.</p>

            Though a common trope in horror movies and Halloween decorations with witches flying across the full moon, the next full moon on Halloween won't occur until 2020.

            The most recent Halloween full moon was back in 2001, and before that it was in 1955.</p>

                 Orange is a symbol of strength and endurance and, along with brown and gold, stands for the harvest and autumn. Black is typically a symbol of death and darkness and acts as a reminder
                 that Halloween once was a festival that marked the boundaries between life and death.</p>
